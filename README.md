# Github Gists Favorites!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Test the application:

These tests are focused on snapshots & the favoriting logic that is used in the tables.

## Future Work & Improvements
 While this app is working how I intended, there is still a lot more work that can be done. One thing that I wanted to achieve was a Github Login for users so that they could search for gists as a user and be able to potentially see private gists. With this login, I would have a separate home page that asks users to login or you can click a link to take you to the search as an anonymous user. Another update that would be nice is the styling of the Navbar, or even changing it to a Tabs structure. I would want to make it look more sleek and user friendly. In regards to showing the listed gists, I would like to be able to order the tables by each column. It would also be a plus to inlclude pagination within the tables in case there were a lot of entries.
